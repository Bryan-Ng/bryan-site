                                    I have been thinking about what "value" means recently:
                                    <br />Individuals are compensated, usually with money, in exchange for the services they provide society. Compensation depends on 1) Society's perspective of how valuable your service is (your value), and 2) How much of society benefits from your services (your audience). 
                                    <br />It is helpful to think about value and audience through different professions.
                                    <br />
                                    <br />The value of Cashiers, is to facilitate transactions between individuals. It's important, but you won't die without seeing a cashier. The audience is limited depending on the goods that are sold and the community they serve. 
                                    <br />The value of Doctors, is to promote health and prevent death. Not dying is important to the individual, and having healthy individuals is important to society (to be productive). Everyone requires health care, however, the audience is limited to the number of patients the Doctor can see in their community.
                                    <br />The value of a Top Manager (e.g. CEO) of a large corporation, is, depending on the principles of the company, to provide valuable services/goods that allow society to run. Their audience is usually large, and serves multiple communities or countries.
                                    <br />
                                    <br />The greater the value (V) and audience (A), the greater the compensation (C). V x A = C.
                                    <br />Even if what you are doing is extremely valuable, if you have no audience, you won't benefit society. 100 x 0 = 0.
                                    <br />If you are doing something that you think is valuable, you need to find an audience for it.

                            <div class="postContent">
                                <p class="postContent">"I haven't read since high school."
                                    <br />"I don't have time to read."
                                    <br />
                                    <br />1. You have the time to read, you just haven't taken the time to try. 
                                    <br />Over the past two years I picked up reading again. I took a conscious effort to read
                                    30 minutes every day, whether it be during my daily commute (I actually prefer public transit now because it forces me to read)
                                    or right before I go to bed. I argue 30 minutes is all the time we need to pick up reading again - we probably spend more time scrolling through Instagram, Twitter, or Facebook, skimming through things that we probably don't care about.
                                    I ended up reading 9 books in my first year, nothing crazy, but it was a big improvement from my usual (0/year).
                                    <br />
                                    <br />2. Reading opens your mind.
                                    <br />Books will introduce to us new ideas, new ways to approach problems, or even challenge our own beliefs. I have a background in health sciences, but I found the most rewarding books to be about history, economics, and business.
                                    I think the beauty of reading is that it makes us realize how little we know about the world. In the movie "Inception", (Spoiler) the protagonist plants an idea into his wife's mind, which ends up changing her perception forever. 
                                    Books introduce ideas that can change the way we understand the world.
                                    <br />
                                    <br />3. Compound effect.
                                    <br />Reading 30 minutes every day adds up to 182.5 hours per year. I'm a slow reader and that led to 9 books. More importantly, we learn more about ourselves and the world with every book. 
                                    These lessons add up in the long run. It's surprising how much you change by creating small, seemingly inconsequential, habits.
                                    <br />
                                    <br />4. Empathy.
                                    <br />Books let us enter the mind of someone who lives a completely different life than we do. We learn what shapes other people's perspectives by learning their culture, their upbringing, and the challenges they've faced. 
                                    We're often stuck in our own bubble and forget to take the effort to understand others. Reading reminds us of the diversity of mankind. We don't need to agree with other people's actions or ideas, but we can't disagree with them unless we really understand them.
                                    I think this is extremely important in today's society.
                                    <br />
                                    <br />5. Learn from other's mistakes.
                                    <br />Most of the challenges we face have probably been solved before by others (others that are, let's face it, much smarter than we are).
                                    We can accelerate our chances of success by learning off of the mistakes others have made and their approach to overcoming similar problems.
                                    As such, I think there is a strong case to be made to study history. If we stop learning, we are doomed to repeat mistakes we've made in the past.
