                                    <br />"I don't have time to read."
                                    <br />
                                    <br />1. We have the time to read, we just haven't taken the time to try. 
                                    <br />Over the past two years I picked up reading again. I took a conscious effort to read
                                    30 minutes every day, whether it be during my daily commute (I actually prefer public transit now because it forces me to read)
                                    or right before I go to bed. I argue 30 minutes is all the time we need to pick up reading again - we probably spend more time scrolling through Instagram, Twitter, or Facebook, skimming through things that we probably don't care about.
                                    I ended up reading 9 books in my first year, nothing crazy, but it was a big improvement from my usual (0/year).
                                    <br />
                                    <br />2. Reading opens your mind.
                                    <br />Books will introduce to us new ideas, new ways to approach problems, or even challenge our own beliefs. I have a background in health sciences, but I found the most rewarding books to be about history, economics, and business.
                                    I think the beauty of reading is that it makes us realize how little we know about the world. In the movie "Inception", (Spoiler) the protagonist plants an idea into his wife's mind, which ends up changing her perception forever. 
                                    Books introduce ideas that can change the way we understand the world.
                                    <br />
                                    <br />3. Compound effect.
                                    <br />Reading 30 minutes every day adds up to 182.5 hours per year. I'm a slow reader and that led to 9 books. More importantly, we learn more about ourselves and the world with every book. 
                                    These lessons add up in the long run. It's surprising how much you change by creating small, seemingly inconsequential, habits.
                                    <br />
                                    <br />4. Empathy.
                                    <br />Books let us enter the mind of someone who lives a completely different life than we do. We learn what shapes other people's perspectives by learning their culture, their upbringing, and the challenges they've faced. 
                                    We're often stuck in our own bubble and forget to take the effort to understand others. Reading reminds us of the diversity of mankind. We don't need to agree with other people's actions or ideas, but we can't disagree with them unless we really understand them.
                                    I think this is extremely important in today's society.
                                    <br />
                                    <br />5. Learn from other's mistakes.
                                    <br />Most of the challenges we face have probably been solved before by others (others that are, lets face it, much smarter than we are).
                                    We can accelerate our chances of success by learning off of the mistakes others have made and their approach to overcoming similar problems.
                                    As such, I think there is a strong case to be made to study history. If we stop learning, we are doomed to repeat mistakes we've made in the past.
                                    <br />
                                    <br />6. Reading makes you a better person.
